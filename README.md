## Group Members:

## About:
All of the code for this assignment is in the Jupyter notebook file
'COMP30027 Assignment 1.ipynb'. The task 2 Questions that were chosen for this
assignment were Question 3, 5 and 6.

The code in the Jupyter notebook is broken up into 3 sections:

- **Section 0: Helper Functions.** The code in this section contains all the
helper functions that are used for the naive Bayes model. This includes
the preprocess, train, predict and evaluate functions.

- **Section 1: Pop vs. Classical Music Classification.** This section contains
all the code that is used for training and testing the naive Bayes model on 
the 'pop_vs_classical_train.csv' and 'pop_vs_classical_test.csv' datasets. 
The model is used to complete questions 1 and 2 of the assignment.

- **Section 2: 10-Way Music Genre Classification.** This section contains
all the code that is used for training and testing the naive Bayes model on 
the 'gztan_train.csv' and 'gztan_test.csv' datasets. There is also code used
for question 3, 5 and 6 in this part.

## How to run the code:
1. Open the Jupyter notebook file 'COMP30027 Assignment 1.ipynb'.
2. Select a Python kernel for the Jupyter notebook.
3. Click the 'Run All' button at the top of the notebook. Alternatively, you
can run each code cell one at a time in the order presented.

**Important Note:** Please run the code cells in the order that it is presented 
in the notebook. Changing the order may lead to errors or unexpected output
that differs from what was expected in the report.

## Report
See "COMP30027 Machine Learning Project 1.pdf" for our final conclusions.
